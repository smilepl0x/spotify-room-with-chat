# spotify-room-with-chat
 Small project using node.js and websockets to sync music from Spotify with your
 friends.

 Only the chat is working at the moment, but to test it:

 1. Make sure node.js is installed on your PC. https://www.nodejs.org

 2. Start a command-line prompt from your installed folder and run:

    npm install

3. Start the app by running:

    node app.js

4. Open a browser and navigate to your localhost with port 5000 appended at
the end. On most home computers it will look like this:

    127.0.0.1:5000

5. You can open this website in multiple tabs to test functionality between
multiple users.
